## The Why?

Why do this?

- Gain more experience.
- To see if I am able to criticize the tech stack I choose for this project.
- To think more on the architecture of the app by choosing the stack myself.

Why not nextjs?

- I have enough nextjs experience with current project.
- The react knowledge is not that good because nextjs as a framework do most of the work.
- Try to understand more the react stack like react router & typescript from scratch.
